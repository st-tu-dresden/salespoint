Salespoint is a Java-based application framework to develop point of sales (PoS) applications using Spring Framework and Spring Boot. It consists of a variety of business modules that allows users to implement sophisticated web applications on top of them.

The framework generally consists of:

* 6 business modules - accountancy, inventory, catalog, orders, business time and user accounts.
* Domain types (entities and value objects) as well as Spring based repository and service implementations to provide Java APIs to be extended by (web) application developers.
* Core Spring application configuration classes to bootstrap the application using Spring Boot.
