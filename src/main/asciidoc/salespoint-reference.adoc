[[preface.introduction]]
== Introduction
The Salespoint Framework is intended to minimize developing effort of point-of-sale applications. Salespoint 2010 users complainted about complexity, missing features and bugs. Thus, the decision was made to re-design and re-implement the framework from scratch. In 2013 some parts again were re-implemented with components of the http://spring.io[Spring framework]. Our development goal was an easy-to-use framework primarily targeted for educational purposes. As such Salespoint is not tailored to any specific application, but designed with a wide area of applications in mind.

Models and design patterns employed in Salespoint are inspired by _Enterprise Patterns and MDA_ <<epam>>. An overview of the functionality of the new features in Salespoint are detailed in this document. We would like to thank all Salespoint users who submitted their feedback and encourage future users of Salespoint to do the same.

[[preface.prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites
Working with Salespoint requires some basic knowledge of the underlying technologies such as the Spring Framework as well as JPA to implement the persistence layer. http://static.olivergierke.de/spring-webapps/index.html[This script] gives you an introduction into these technologies. Also the https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/guestbook[Guestbook] sample project is a good starting point to get familiar with the technology stack.

=== The Videoshop sample project
To give you an example of what applications built on top of Salespoint can actually look like, we provide the https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/videoshop[Videoshop] sample project that covers a few key areas:

* Using and extending the business modules provided by Salespoint to abstract a concrete problem domain.
* Implementing a web layer (controllers, views) on top of Java based business services of that business domain.
* Adding the necessary bits and pieces for technical aspects such as security and transactions.

TIP: The following sections will refer to code of the sample project here and there so it might be useful to have the repository cloned and the project imported into your IDE of choice to quickly be able to navigate these.

[[architecture]]
= Technical Architecture

Technically Salespoint is a library to build Java based Point of Sales (PoS) applications. Whiles these applications are usually implemented as web applications, large parts of Salespoint are also usable if the application architecture of choice is a rich client implemented in Java.

The technical foundation for Salespoint is the Spring Frameworkfootnote:[Spring Framework - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework[Wikipedia]] and Spring Boot (as some kind of opinionated layer on top of Spring Framework to ease its applicance to a large degree. Salespoint is built using the Maven build systemfootnote:[Apache Maven - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven[Wikipedia]]. The reference documentation and static website are built with Asciidoctorfootnote:[Asciidoctor - http://asciidoctor.org[Website]].

Here you can find the link:images/salespoint-classdiagram.png[salespoint class diagram] about the basic structure.

[[architecture.core-concepts]]
== Core concepts
Before we dive into the technical details of Salespoint, let's make sure we understand some core concepts that will help us understand the different modules of the framework a bit better. Each of the <<modules, modules>> consists of a bit of code and the classes can usually be grouped into 3 different buckets: entities and value objects, summarized to <<architecture.core-concepts.ddd.newables, newables>>, repositories and services, summarized to <<architecture.core-concepts.ddd.injectables, injectables>> as well as <<architecture.core-concepts.container-configuration, Spring container configuration and extension code>>. The following sections will cast some light on these kinds of types and their special traits.

////
[[architecture.core-concepts.ddd.newables]]
=== Entities and value objects

TODO
////

[[architecture.core-concepts.ddd.injectables]]
=== Repositories, services and controllers

Repositories and services are used ot interact with entities and value objects. Repositories usually abstract data access into an interface that simulates a collection of entities that instances can be added to, or looked up using a parameterized criteria like "all users with a certain lastname like…". As Salespoint is using a relational database as persistence backend it leverages the Java Persistence API (JPA) and <<stack.spring-data-jpa, Spring Data JPA>> to implement repositories.

As repositories abstract a collection of an aggregate root (e.g. an order with it's charge and line items), we usually need a higher level abstraction that exposes a more use-case oriented API: a service. It fulfils a more coarse grained set of operations that might include the interaction with multiple repositories, trigger other services in the system etc.

Repositories, services and controllers are types whose instances are managed by the Spring container. Thus they're never instantiated manually in the application code, except for unit testing purposes. Application code uses dependency injection to access

////
[[architecture.core-concepts.container-configuration]]
=== Container configuration and extensions

TODO
////

[[architecture.maven]]
== Maven
_Maven_ simplifies the management of project dependencies, furthermore it downloads and organizes all dependencies. Another focus of _Maven_ is the management of a project's build. All settings are placed in the `pom.xml` file (http://maven.apache.org/pom.html).

[[architecture.spring]]
== Spring
In contrast to earlier versions of the Salespoint Framework, Salespoint obeys the MVC pattern. Salespoint mostly provides the application services to interact with the the model of an MVC application as no parts of the view or the controller are implemented in the framework.

Salespoint is designed as foundation for development of web applications, using the Spring Framework to implement views, controllers and business services abstracting the domain your application-to-be-created is applied to. To ease this development, Salespoint includes a few extensions to the Spring Framework that will avoid you having to implement very tedious tasks over and over again. Read more about this in <<stack.spring>>.

As a big new approach in development with JPA, the Spring Framework with its repository interfaces can make the work very fast, clean and easy. The Crudrepository provides the basic methods for working with the database (CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete).

[[modules]]
= Business modules

Salespoint ships with a set of business modules that interact with each other.
The following component diagram shows the overall structure of the setup.
The relationships are used as follows:

* __uses__ -- The module has a Spring component dependency and actively interacts with the target module. Implies a type dependency into the target module as well.
* __listens to__ -- The module contains an event listener for events the target modules publishes. Implies a type dependency into the target module as well.
* __depends on__ -- The module has a general type dependency to the target module, i.e. it uses the target module as library.

[[modules.useraccount]]
== User accounts

plantuml::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.useraccount.uml[,,svg,title="User account component"]
include::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.useraccount.adoc[]

////

[User]->[Password]
////
image::user.png[title="User Account"]

image::user-account.png[title="User Account Management"]

While Spring Security is used as primary technology to actually implement application security, there's also a domain abstraction of a user acoount in the form of a `UserAccount` entity.
That means that `UserAccount` instances created within the system are automatically targets for authentication.
The primary purpose of a `UserAccount` besides the security integration is the ability to assign other business entities like an order or a reservation to an account.
A `UserAccount` primarily consists of a `UserAccountIdentifier` whose `String` representation is used as the login name and a `Password` (representing an encrypted or non-encrypted password) value object.

To create `UserAccounts`, the ``UserAccountManager``'s method `create(String userName, String password, Role... role)` can be used.
The `String` given as password will be encrypted using Spring Security.
Also, it makes sure that the login names are unique and a password is always set.

[[modules.useraccount.role]]
=== Roles
As the name suggests, a `Role` represents the role a `UserAccount` has. It is usually used in security expressions with either `@Secured` or in a Thymeleaf template to restrict access to functionality or change the appearance of a view depending on a user’s status.
A view for a user having an administrator role may display different content -- e.g. delete buttons -- than for a user not having that role.

`Role` is a value typefootnote:value-objects[http://blog.joda.org/2014/03/valjos-value-java-objects.html[Value Objects]] and thus instances are created using a factory method: `Role.of("ROLE_ADMIN");`.

Up until Salespoint 7.2.0, roles' names had to start with `ROLE_`, so that they could be used for verifications in Spring Security expressions in Thymeleaf templates (via `sec:authorize` attributes) or on methods (using the `@PreAuthorize` annotation) with their plain name.
I.e. users had to be created with `Role.of("ROLE_CUSTOMER")` but the verifications would have used `hasRole("CUSTOMER")` expressions.
This asymmetry has been fixed with Salespoint 7.2.1 in which the role itself can also be set up using an unprefixed name like `CUSTOMER`.

[[modules.useraccount.login]]
=== Login
To reduce code repetition, Salespoint contains code to automate the user log in. Using a Thymeleaf template, a special login form is generated, which is handled by an interceptor. The interceptor verifies the user password and associates the current session with the user using `<login>` and `<logoff>`. The session is required, because multiple users can be logged on at the same time.

[[modules.useraccount.login.via-email]]
As of version 7.1, Salespoint allows the login via a user's registered email address.
To enable that, set `salespoint.authentication.login-via-email` to `true`.

.Configuring Salespoint to use an email for login purposes (in `application.properties`)

[source]
----
salespoint.authentication.login-via-email=true
----


If the option is activated, `UserAccountManager.save(…)` will reject `UserAccount` instances that don't have an email address set.
That means you need to provide an email when initially registering, i.e. you'll need to use the overload of `UserAccountManager.create(…)` that takes an email address as parameter.

[[modules.useraccount.loggedin]]
=== @LoggedIn annotation
The `@LoggedIn` annotation can be used to inject the currently logged in `UserAccount` into controller method parameters. The type of the annotated paramater can either be
`Optional<UserAccount>` for methods that should support non-authenticated access, or `UserAccount`. With the former variant, `Optional.map()` can be conveniently used to react
to the presence of the user account in a functional programming style:

.Example of a controller method parameter annotated with @LoggedIn

[source, java]
----
@Controller
public class ExampleController {
    @GetMapping("/example")
    String example(@LoggedIn Optional<UserAccount> userAccount) {
        // functional style using map and lambda expression:
        return userAccount.map(account -> {
            // things to be done if the user account is present
            return "...";
        }).orElse("redirect:/");  // if the user account is *not* present
    }
}
----



[[modules.useraccount.limitation]]
=== Limitation
The `org.salespointframework.useraccount.UserAccount` is limited to the given attributes and methods.
Due to the fact, that Salespoint use the `SecurityContext` for authentication, the `UserAccount` cannot be extended. In the background the `org.salespointframework.useraccount.UserAccount` is converted to an instance of `org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails`.

If these properties don’t meet all requirements, wrap the `UserAccount` in a new entity. Put all the new features in this new entity and connect this information via a `@OneToOne` relationship with the `UserAccount`. An example can be found in the Videoshop project.

.Example of a UserAccount extension

[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class UserAccountExtension {

  private String string;
  private Integer integer;

  @OneToOne
  private UserAccount userAccount;

  …
}
----


[[modules.quantity]]
== Quantity
`Quantity` is used to represent amounts of anything. Furthermore a `Quantity` can be used to calc with (plus, minus).
But only `Quantities` with the same `Metric` can be combined or compared, so every `Quantity` has an `Metric` attribute.

And of course, every `Quantity` has an amount value, represented as a `java.math.BigDecimal`.

[[modules.quantity.metric]]
=== Metric
The composite type `Metric` contains all information pertaining to the unit or metric of the represented object.
Furthermore, an object of type `Metric` has a description field, to explain the meaning of the metric in detail. For the example of a meter a possible description could be "The meter is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.".

[[modules.catalog]]
== Catalog

plantuml::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.catalog.uml[,,svg,title="Catalog component"]
include::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.catalog.adoc[]

Salespoint is intended as framework for point-of-sale applications. Items for sale are called products and represented by instances of the class `Product`. To represent different kinds of products, `Product` can be sub-classed. Products are managed by a `Catalog` implementation (see below). Products are identified using a `ProductIndentifier`.

The `Catalog` interface was designed to manage `Product` instances in the system. It provides functionality to add, remove, and find products. Products can be searched by their name or category. The `PersistentCatalog` is an implementation of the `Catalog` interface.

[[modules.inventory]]
== Inventory

plantuml::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.inventory.uml[,,svg,title="Inventory component"]
include::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.inventory.adoc[]

The inventory package contains functionality to keep track of the amount of items we have for a given `Product` (see <<modules.catalog>> for details).
`Inventory` is a simple Spring Data repository, that allows to access `InventoryItem` instances and acts as base type for the actual concrete provided inventory interfaces.
A Salespoint application usually decides for one of the following models and uses one or the other inventory repositories throughout the entire application.

[[modules.inventory.unique]]
=== UniqueInventory -- one inventory item per product

This model assumes that there is a single `InventoryItem` created per `Product` instance.
This approach acts like there is a single warehouse keeping track of the stock for a given `Product`.
It's the easier mode as the `Quantity` provided in the `InventoryItem` is logically equivalent to the number of items available for a given `Product`.

``UniqueInventoryItem``s will also automatically be deducted for order completions (see <<modules.inventory.events>>).

[[modules.inventory.multi]]
=== MultiInventory -- multiple inventory items per product

In case you need to model multiple warehouses that store products, `MultiInventory` relaxes the relationship between `Product` and `InventoryItem` to a 1:n one.
This of course results in `…findByProductIdentifier(…)` returning a `InventoryItems` (note the plural) instance which is a collection of all `InventoryItem` instances available.
`InventoryItems` exposes a `….getTotalQuantity()` to easily obtain the overall number of items available across all ``InventoryItem``s.

`MultiInventoryItems` are not automatically deduced upon order completions as it's not clear, which of the `MultiInventoryItem` instances to reduce the quantity for.

[[modules.inventory.events]]
=== Handling order completion events

The inventory ships with a listener for `OrderCompleted` events (see <<modules.order.lifecycle>> for details) to update the stock for each line item contained in an `Order` that is managed by a `UniqueInventoryItem`.
By default, an `OrderCompletionFailure` is thrown in case any of the `OrderLine` items aren't available in the required amount.
The exception contains an `OrderCompletionReport` that can be inspected for the item lacking enough stock.

By default, all `OrderLine` instances are processed.
If you want to disable order updates completely, configure the property `salespoint.inventory.disable-updates` to `true`.
However, you might want to only exclude some of them as the `Product` they point to don't represent a product to keep track of (e.g. some service like "gift wrapping" or the like.
The `LineItemFilter` interface allows defining a strategy to decide which of the `OrderLine` instances are supposed to be processed by the inventory.

To customize the strategy, simply declare an implementation of `LineItemFilter` as Spring bean to your application configuration:

.Declaring a custom line item filter
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-base-test}/inventory/InventoryOrderEventListenerTests.java[tags=custom-line-item-filter]
----

A declaration like this will cause only `OrderLine` instances pointing to `Product` instance with a matching name to be subject for reduction in the inventory.

On `OrderCancelled` the `Inventory` will restock if the `Order` has already been completed.
See link:{javadoc}/org/salespointframework/inventory/InventoryOrderEventListener.html[the Javadoc of the event listener] for details.

[[modules.accountancy]]
== Accountancy

plantuml::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.accountancy.uml[,,svg,title="Accountancy component"]
include::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.accountancy.adoc[]

The accountancy package contains functionality supporting book keeping. `AccountancyEntry` is a representation of an accounting entry. `Accountancy` aggregates ``AccountancyEntry``s. Every `AccountancyEntry` is uniquely identified by an ``AccountancyEntryIdentifier``. `AccountancyEntry` extends `AbstractEntity` and serves as persistence entity, while `PersistentAccountancy` implements `Accountancy` and provides transparent access to the JPA layer. `AccountancyEntryIdentifier` is used as primary key attribute, when entities are stored in the database.

////
[<<Interface>> Accountancy]^-.-[PersistentAccountancy]
[PersistentAccountancy]uses-.->[<<Interface>> AccountancyEntryRepository]
[AccountancyEntry|-id:AccountancyEntryIdentifier]
////
image::accountancy.png[Accountancy, title="Accountancy"]

By implementing and sub-classing `Accountancy`, the notion of different accounts, as known from double-entry bookkeeping, can be realized.

To create a new account, `AccountancyEntry` has to be sub-classed. Every object of such a class belongs to the same account. Accessing per-account entries is facilitated by specifiying the desired class type when calling `get()` or `find()` methods of `Accountancy`.

[[modules.accountancy.events]]
=== Handling OrderPaid events

The accountancy subsystem handles `OrderPaid` events by creating a `ProductPaymentEntry` for the order.
Reversely, it will create a compensating `ProductPaymentEntry` on `OrderCancelled` if theres a revenue `ProductPaymentEntry` available for `Order`.
See link:{javadoc}/org/salespointframework/accountancy/AccountancyOrderEventListener.html[the Javadoc of the event listener] for details.

[[modules.payment]]
== Payments

////
[PaymentMethod]^[Cash]
[PaymentMethod]^[Cheque]
[PaymentMethod]^[PaymentCard]
[PaymentCard]^[DebitCard]
[PaymentCard]^[CreditCard]
////
image::payment-method.png[title="Payment domain types"]

For the paying transaction, Salespoint provides some payment strategies.

* `DebitCard` -- representation of e.g. EC-card or MaestroCard
* `CreditCard` -- equal to `DebitCard` but with creditLimit-Attribute
* `Cheque` -- represents a written order of payment in a digital form
* `Cash` -- represents a payment, made direct in cash

[[modules.order]]
== Order management

plantuml::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.order.uml[,,svg,title="Order component"]
include::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.order.adoc[leveloffset=1]

The order management is centered around the `Order` aggregate that aggregates link:{javadoc}/org/salespointframework/order/OrderLine.html[``OrderLine``]s and link:{javadoc}/org/salespointframework/order/ChargeLine.html[``ChargeLine``]s.
An `OrderLine` refers to a `Product` from the <<modules.catalog>> in combination with a `Quantity`.
Note, that the `OrderLine`  creates a copy of the ``Product``s description and price, so that changes to those attributes of a `Product` don't affect existing `Orders`.
A `ChargeLine` describes any additional charge that can be associated with the `Order`, e.g. discounts, any general service charges and so on.

``AttachedChargeLine`` are special ``ChargeLine``s that are attached to an ``OrderLine``.
Just as a standard `ChargeLine` they can be used to add charged services or discounts but attached to the particular `OrderLine` instead of the overall `Order`.

`Order` exposes a variety of methods to lookup

[[modules.order.class-diagram]]
.Order domain classes
====
[plantuml, order, svg]
....
class OrderLine {
+ getProductIdentifier() : ProductIdentifier
+ getDescription() : String
+ getPrice() : MonetaryAmount
}

class ChargeLine {
+ getPrice() : MonetaryAmount
+ getDescription() : String
}

class AttachedChargeLine extends ChargeLine
AttachedChargeLine --> OrderLine

class Order {
+ addOrderLine(…) : OrderLine
+ addChargeLine(…) : ChargeLine
+ addChargeLine(…, OrderLine) : AttachedChargeLine
}

Order "1" *-- "0..*" OrderLine
Order "1" *-- "0..*" ChargeLine
Order "1" *-- "0..*" AttachedChargeLine
....
====

[[modules.order.lifecycle]]
=== The Order lifecycle

An `Order` is an aggregate rootfootnote:[ http://static.olivergierke.de/lectures/ddd-and-spring/#ddd.building-blocks.aggregates[Aggregate root]], which means that state changes to it that have important business meaning trigger events.

[[modules.order.lifecycle-diagram]]
.Order lifecycle
====
[plantuml, order-lifecycle, svg]
....
hide empty description
[*] -> Open
Open -> Paid : markPaid()
Open -> Cancelled : cancel(…)
Paid -> Cancelled : cancel(…)
Paid -> Completed : complete()
Completed -> Cancelled : cancel()
....
====

These events are then used by other business modules to act on them.
Currently, the following events are exposed:

* `OrderPaid` -- the event being thrown if the order gets paid, usually through a call to `OrderManager.pay(…)`. The <<modules.accountancy>> module makes use of those events as described in <<modules.accountancy.events>>.
* `OrderCompleted` -- the event being thrown when the `Order` is about to be completed, usually through a call to `OrderManager.completeOrder(…)`.
The <<modules.inventory>> module ships with a listener for the `OrderCompleted` event to update the inventory and reduce the stock of ordered items.
See <<modules.inventory.events>> for details.
* `OrderCancelled` -- the event being thrown when an `Order` was cancelled, usually through `OrderManager.cancelOrder(…)`. <<modules.accountancy>> will react by creating a new `AccountancyEntry` that compensates for the revenue entry created for the `OrderPaid` event. <<modules.inventory>> will restore the previously subtracted stock if the order had been cancelled already.

[[modules.order.handling-events]]
==== Handling events

In case you want to write custom code to react to those events you need to implement an event handler.
An event handler is a simple Spring component that has methods annotated with either `@EventListener` or `@TransactionalEventListener`.

[source, java]
----
@Component
class MyEventListener {

	@EventListener
	public void handleEvent(OrderCompleted event) {
		// Your code goes here
	}

	// alternatively

	@TransactionalEventListener
	public void handleEventAfterTransaction(OrderCompleted event) {
		// Your code goes here
	}
}
----

The difference between the two methods is when they're actually invoked by the framework.
The former method is called before the changes to the database are eventually persisted to the database.
That means, the event listener can throw an exception and the action that caused the event to be published in the first place will be canceled, too.
On the other hand an `@EventListener` will not be guaranteed that the original action will succeed as it might be rejected if it violates e.g. database constraints.
In contrast, a `@TransactionalEventListener` will be called after the original action has completed successfully.
That in turn means, that the listener has no chance to abort that action.

[[modules.business-time]]
== Business time

include::{generated-docs}/moduliths/module-org.salespointframework.time.adoc[]

To be able to simulate the state of the system in a given point in time all components in the system that set a point in time on entities or lookup the current time use the `BusinessTime` interface.

By default, the implementation will just return the current system date. However, it also allows to "forward" the current business time by calling the `BusinessTime.forward(…)` method. This will augment the current business time by the duration handed into the method. E.g. forwading the business time by 2 months will return the very same time but two months ahead for each call to `BusinessTime.getTime()`.

This is particularly useful for demoing purposes if e.g. orders can be timed to a certain date, credit cards become invalid after a certain point in time etc.

////
[<<Interface>> BusinessTime]^[DefaultBusinessTime]
////
image::business-time.png[title="Business time"]

[[modules.technical-apis]]
== Technical APIs

Besides the business modules, Salespoint containes a few <<glossary.spi,SPIs>> that can be used to extend the functionality of the core framework. These SPIs usually exist to make repeated use-cases easier to implement and free you from writing too much boilerplate code.

[[modules.technical-apis.data-initializer]]
=== DataInitializer

Every application should be tested, so an easy way is, to use test data. Salespoint provides an SPI called `DataInitializer` for you to implement. If your implementation is registered as Spring bean (e.g. by annotating it with `@Component`), it will automatically be found and `initialize()` will be called at application startup. As shown in the Videoshop project, a `DataInitializer` class is registered and creates a lot of data and finally adds this data to the application.

[[modules.technical-apis.webmvc-entity-binding]]
=== Entity binding in WebMVC controller methods

Controller methods can bind request parameters and path variables to entity instances directly if the value to be bound is an identifier of the entity to bind.
Assuming a controller method displaying a form registers an entity with the model:

[source, java]
----
@Controller
class MyController {

  @GetMapping("/myform")
  String displayForm(Model model) {

    Order order = … // Order with id 4711.

    model.addAttribute("order", order);

    return "myform";
  }
}
----

The identifier of the order can be used in anchors and form values like this.

[source, hmtl]
----
<!-- Expands to /orders/4711 -->
<a th:href="@{/orders/{id}(id=${order.id})}" …>…</a>

<form th:object="${myForm}" …>
  <input type="hidden" name="order" th:value="${order.id}" />
  …
</form>
----

When following the link or submitting the form the identifier can be bound to the backing entity type directly:

[source, java]
----
@Controller
class MyController {

  @GetMapping("/order/{order}")
  String displayForm(Order order) { … }
}
----

Note how we do not use a `String` or e.g. `Long` parameter type as controller method parameter but the entity type directly.
This is achieved by Spring MVC trying to convert the source `String` value submitted through the request into the identifier type of the entity in the first place as well as a subsequent repository lookup using the identifier value just created.
In the above example we'd convert `"4711"` to a `Long` 4711 (assuming the identifier of `Order` is declared as `Long`).
That in turn gets converted into an `Order` instance by calling `OrderRepository.findById(Long)` with the just converted value.

https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/salespoint/issues/226[#226] -- We added the ability to register `ChargeLine` instances for a dedicated `OrderLine`.
Read more about that in the updated section of <<modules.order>>.

==== New order cancelled event and fixes in event handling in general
https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/salespoint/issues/230[#230] -- The creation of a `PaymentAccountancyEntry` has been properly attached to the `OrderPaid` event now.
An `OrderCancelled` event is now published on order cancellation which triggers a rollback of the inventory updates as well as a compensating `ProductPaymentEntry`.
Read more on that in the updated section <<modules.order.lifecycle>>.

[[new-and-noteworthy.whats-new-in-6.1]]
=== What's new in Salespoint 6.1?
==== Upgrade to Spring Boot 1.2 and Spring 4.1
For Salespoint 6.1 we upgraded to Spring Boot 1.2, which transitively updates a few third party dependencies, most notably Spring 4.1. Read more on the new features of Spring Boot in its http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.x/reference/htmlsingle[reference documentation] and skim through the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-1.2-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-11[upgrade notes] as well. The new features of Spring 4.1 are described http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.1.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#new-in-4.1[here].

==== New @EnableSalespoint annotation to simplify configuration
Activating Salespoint in a web application has been quite cumbersome so far and required a dedicated set of annotations and imports of configuration classes. To simplify this, Salespoint 6.1 introduces `@EnableSalespoint` to take care of the previously manual steps. For more information on what gets acivated and imported, see the link:{javadoc}/org/salespointframework/EnableSalespoint.html[JavaDoc of the annotation].

==== Usage of the mail autoconfiguration shipping with Spring Boot 1.2
As Salespoint 6.1 upgrades to Spring Boot 1.2 we now use the email auto-configuration settings shipping with that release. This most notably means that you slightly have to alter your properties to configure the mail user, password and host. See Boot's http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.x/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-email[reference documentation] and the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.0.RC2/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties[list of current application properties] for details.

== FAQ

[qanda]
Why do I see warning log statements about database tables not being accessible at startup?::
  This is due to a bug in Hibernate in combination with HSQLDB and constraints in databases. Hibernate tries to drop those on application startup but fails to as the (in-memory database) is empty. See https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-9038[this bug report] for reference.

How do I send emails from a Salespoint application?::
  Salespoint has everything prepared for you in terms of necessary dependencies. All you need to do is configure the following properties in `application.properties`:
+
[source]
----
spring.mail.host=
spring.mail.username=
spring.mail.password=
----
If these properties get real values assigned, Salespoint will automatically create a Spring component of type `JavaMailSender` for you that you can inject into your clients and use to send emails. See the Spring reference documentation on details for that.
+
WARNING: Never push your email credentials into the version control system.
+
Alternatively for testing purposes, configure the `RecordingMailSender` as a Spring bean to simply write emails to be sent to the console instead of sending them to a real SMTP server. To automatically switch between the two setups have a look at how to use Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-profiles[profile support with Boot].

== Glossary

[[glossary.dependency-injection]]
Dependency injection::
   Dependency injection is a software design pattern that implements inversion of control and allows a program design to follow the dependency inversion principle. The term was coined by Martin Fowler. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection[Wikipedia].

[[glossary.spi]]
SPI::
   Service Provider Interface -- interfaces to be implemented to extend the functionality of the core framework. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface[Wikipedia] for details.
